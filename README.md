# Modelling-Starbucks-Coffee-Time-Using-Markov-Chains

# Introduction
Markov Chains are powerful mathematical tools used to model a sequence of events where the future state depends only on the current state. In the context of Starbucks coffee time, Markov Chains can provide a fascinating way to simulate and understand the dynamics of how people move through different coffee-drinking states during their visit to Starbucks.

This project aims to model Starbucks coffee time using Markov Chains, offering insights into the various stages a customer might go through while enjoying their coffee. By analyzing historical data and patterns, we can create a probabilistic model that captures the transitions between different states, such as ordering, waiting, socializing, and leaving.

# Conclusion
This project offers a unique perspective on Starbucks coffee time by employing Markov Chains to model customer behaviors and activities. By leveraging the power of probabilistic modeling, we can gain a deeper understanding of how customers move through different states during their visit, providing Starbucks and other coffee establishments with valuable insights for optimizing their services and customer experiences.
